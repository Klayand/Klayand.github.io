# üìù Research Publications

## CFA: Class-wise Calibrated Fair Adversarial Training (CVPR 2023)
**Zeming Wei**, Yifei Wang, Yiwen Guo, Yisen Wang
- Theoretically and empirically investigate the preference of different classes for adversarial configurations in Adversarial Training (AT)
- Propose a CFA framework which customizes specific training configurations for each class automatically
- CFA improves both overall robustness and fairness, and can be easily incorporated into other AT variants

## Extracting Weighted Finite Automata from Recurrent Neural Networks for Natural Languages (ICFEM 2022)
**Zeming Wei**, Xiyue Zhang, Meng Sun
- Identify the transition sparsity and the context dependency problem in WFA extraction from RNNs in natural language tasks
- Propose an extraction approach which complement the missing rules and enhance the context-aware ability
- Our extraction framework is scalable to natural language tasks and of better extration precision
